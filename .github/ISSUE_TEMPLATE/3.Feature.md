***************************************
*********** FORM USAGE ****************
***************************************

To fill out this form properly go through the document except for the Dev Ops section.

Where you find [XXX] replace it with a single line of text
Where you find { xxx } replace it with multiple lines

For some places you will find suggestions below. Using them ensures fewer problems with automation

Ex: 

> ### Test: [xxx]
> [!--- test1 | test2 ---]
> ### Values
>
> { yyy }

becomes:

> ### Test: test1
> ### Values
> 
> value 1
> value 2

Notes:
    - If you pick something that doesn't fit the format the auto labeling will not happen
    - It can take a short while after submission for it to happen
    - It is case-insensitive
    - Updating the description will update the labels as well

****************************************
********** Manual Labeling *************
****************************************

There are some common manual labels that can be applied:

| Reason                      | Label to add   |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| If it is urgent             | "M | Urgent"   |
| -------------------------------------------  |
| If this issue is blocking   | "M | Blocking" |
| your work                   |                |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| If this issue being blocked | "M | Blocked"  |
| -------------------------------------------- |
